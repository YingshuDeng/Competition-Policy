Why protect competition
1.  Allocation efficiency: - monopoly results in deadweight loss. Moreover, firms compete to become a monopoly with rent-seeking.
2.  Productive efficiency: -  competition provides incentives to lower costs, and this does not hold in monopolist market.
3.  dynamic efficiency - some market power to reward past achievement, but how much?

More specifically,
Allocative efficiency – is about ensuring resources are allocated between alternative uses in a way that maximises community wellbeing.

Productive efficiency – describes the situation in which output is being produced at is lowest possible average cost. This occurs when an organisation, industry or the economy as a whole is operating on its production possibility frontier (i.e. producing the maximum output from a given set of inputs).

Dynamic efficiency – involves improving allocative and productive efficiency over time. This can mean developing new or better products and finding better ways of producing goods and services. Learning, investment and innovation are key elements of dynamic efficiency and central to the ability of an organisation, industry or economy to adjust to changing circumstances.

# Example 1:
    Model: 
    1. We have n firms,
    2. stage 1: each firm i can invest to lower its costs from c to c − xi
    3, stage 2: Cournot competition
This is solved by backward induction, from stage 2,

Optimal investment incentives,
1. Invest to increase demand: appropriability effect
2. Invest to be better than your competitors
3. costs of investing

# How to define whether a firm has dominant position?
Market definition: A market is a set of products and geographical areas that
exercise competitive constraint on each other:
1. Subsitute,
2. Geographical 

-Assessment of relevant market
SSNIP test: (Small but Significant Non-transitory Increase In Prices)
is 5 - 10% price increase above current level profitable? if yes, a seperate market is identified.

Horizontal mergers: when the two firms are competitors in the same market. This is in contrast with vertical mergers, where one company is a supplier of the other.

-Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): sum of the square of the market shares. HHI should not be too big.


# Merger Paradox
# Example
-A Cournot market with n symmetric firms, and what happens if m < n firms merge?
Outsider firms: price goes up, and their output goes up,
For the mergering firm, only merger to near monopoly is profitable.

- However, we miss the cost efficiency, and cost efficiencies are good for welfare.
- Merger might reshuffle production to more efficient firms

# Farrell and Shapiro (1990)'s model with asymmetric cost:

-When do cost savings lead to lower prices?
The merged entity must increase production for price to go down, and the outside producer will respond by cutting production.

Farrell and Shapiro’s proposition 1:
Price go down iff: the post-mergering profit margin is larger than the sum of two pre-mergering profit margins. Hence, even reshuffling production to lower cost plants is not sufficient.

-When do mergers lead to higher total welfare?
If the merging parties are happy, then presumably they are better off. Need to check what happens with rivals: 

If price still go up, can welfare still increase?

Hence, check how consumer surplus and outsider firm's profit change with Q.

Three effects:
consumers lose from higher price.\\
and firms win from expanded production and higher price.


# Mergers under price competition
Bertrand competition? (with differentiated goods): The partial equilibrium model of differentiated goods.

Three effect of increasing own-price:
1) increase in price margin,
2) decrease in sale,
3) increase in sales of other products in your portfolio,

Hence, mergering changes which firm's profit you internalize, and this is more important for close competitors,

Calibration: posit parameters in the demand model such that pre-merger prices and quantities are exactly reproduced,

1) adding-up: change in pi changes market-shares, but keeps sum
of si equal to 1,

2) homogeneity: if al prices increase same percentage, no change
in shares,

3) proportionality: the share lost as a result of a price increase is allocated
to the other firms in the relevant market in proportion to their respective
shares. 


Chicago school critique questioned the rationale of “leverage of monopoly power”:
 1) Supplier can already earn monopoly profits by dealing with all
retailers
 2) excluding some even harms profits if there is downstream
differentiation

# The Aghion and Bolton model
Suppose the monopolist M and the buyer B write a contract which
specifies
- exclusivity (including some price $p_m$)
- buyer B can break exclusivity, pays damages $d$ to $M$.

# Tying
Many firms sell complementary goods A and B. Tying means if you buy from A, you also have to buy B from the same firm.
However, The Chicago critique:
Tying to reduce competition in the competitive segment does not make sense ,Since consumers who buy the complementary good will also buy the monopoly good.
-> Reducing competition in the market of complements is not monopolist's interest.

Whinston’s (1990) model of entry deterrence, 
Mean idea :M threatens to give up some of its profits in the A market to drive E away from the B market. Hence, M monopolize both markets.
